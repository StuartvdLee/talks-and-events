# Azure Fest 2025 - Building your own MCP server

This is a talk I gave at [Azure Fest 2025](https://www.azurefest.nl/2025/session/building-your-own-mcp-server). The talk was in English.

## Talk Title

### Building your own MCP server

## Abstract

The Model Context Protocol is all the rage and rightly so. As the USB-C for AI it is an incredibly powerful tool that acts as a bridge between real-world systems and LLMs. But how do you get started with MCP and more importantly: how do you build your own MCP server?

In this session we'll get our teeth stuck in these and many more questions and we'll use Azure AI Foundry to build our own MCP server along the way.

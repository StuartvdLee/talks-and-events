# Made for Dev by Global AI Community - Building your own MCP server

This is a talk I gave for [Made for Dev by Global AI Community](https://github.com/GlobalAICommunity/made-for-dev). The talk was in English.

## Talk Title

### Building your own MCP server

## Abstract

The Model Context Protocol is all the rage and rightly so. As the USB-C for AI it is an incredibly powerful tool that acts as a bridge between real-world systems and LLMs. But how do you get started with MCP and more importantly: how do you build your own MCP server?

In this session we'll build an MCP server from scratch using the MCP C# SDK. We'll look at how to build tools, prompts and resources and how to leverage these using GitHub Copilot.
